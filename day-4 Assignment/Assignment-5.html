      college life is awsome  
      everyday is a memorable day.
      the day i remember as memorable is my first day in colleg,all are temperary strangers and life long friends.on the first day we have college visit,everyone asking different different doubts about college,everyone has a expression of fear and enthusiasm on their face,sincerely i too don't know everyones names,but we have a bond that classmate,new professors,new surrondings like happydays movie i too imagined about my coolege life literally i know that we don't have that chance to rag our juniors bla bla.
      but it will remain as memorable movement in my life   </p>
